This is uasniffer, a Java library for user agent sniffing. It analyzes a
User-Agent header sent in an HTTP request and describes what kind of user
agent this header indicates.

The main class is the Sniffer class in the com.pensioenpage.jynx.uasniffer
package.

This utility program has no external dependencies other than the Java
runtime environment, version 1.5 or higher.

This software requires the following to build (with 'ant jar'):

   - J2SE 1.5 or Java SE 6
   - Ant 1.7.1

To run the unit tests (using 'ant unittests'), the following libraries need to
be in the classpath (or passed with 'ant -lib CLASSPATH'):

   - ant-junit.jar    (tested with Ant 1.7.1)
   - junit.jar        (tested with JUnit 4.0)
   - commons-io.jar   (tested with Commons IO 1.4)
